# TODO: Add no.webp to the 'No' Response Page and Replace GIF on 'Yes' Page

- [x] Add an img element for 'no.webp' in the 'no' response section of App.tsx, positioned before the emojis (falling petals and 😔💕) for a sleek appearance.
- [x] Style the image similarly to the 'yes' response GIF, with appropriate classes for responsiveness and animation.
- [x] Replace the GIF on the 'yes' response page with 'happy.webp' from the public folder, maintaining the same styling and position.
